  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>After graduating university, I moved to Japan to become an English teacher, where I taught both children and adults. I learned the importance of working as a team to make our small schools a success, as well as understanding the needs of my students to provide them with exactly what they need. 
  I am studying with <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> to change my career and become a software developer! So far, my journey into a new career has been very insightful and fun!</p>
